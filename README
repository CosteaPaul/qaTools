A couple of useful qa tools for sequencing data.

I. Setup:

   Change Makefile $SAMTOOLS path to your samtools instalation path.
   If you don't have samtools, you can find it here:
      http://samtools.sourceforge.net/

   Just run make and you should be done!

II. Tools:

1. qaCompute
   Computes normal and span coverage from a bam/sam file.
   Also counts unmapped and sub-par quality reads.
   For more info on the parameteres try ./qaCompute

2. removeUnmapped
   Remove unmapped and sub-par quality reads from a bam/sam file.
   For more info on the parameters try ./removeUnmapped

3. computeInsertSizeHistogram
   Compute the insert size distribution from a bam/sam file.
   For more info on the parameters try ./computeInsertSizeHistogram
